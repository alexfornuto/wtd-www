Announcing Presentations and Speakers
=====================================

Our talk selection process has just wrapped up and we're eager to
announce the presentations for this year's conference. Each year we
select talks that emphasize intersections between tech writers and
developers, because we all have so much to learn from each other.

In the next few weeks, we'll be announcing the details for the
conference events: the annual hike on Saturday, the writing day and
reception on Sunday, and the official party on Monday evening.

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, you still have some time. You
can pick up your tickets
`here <http://writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/#tickets>`__.

Coming to Portland, but need help planning your stay? We have published
some `resources on where to stay and how to get
around <http://writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/visiting/>`__.
