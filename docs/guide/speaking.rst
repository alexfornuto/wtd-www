Giving a Presentation at Write the Docs
---------------------------------------

Are you planning to speak at Write the Docs? Great! Here's a few things
that may help you plan your presentation and the slides for your
presentation.

Facts
~~~~~

-  Your talk will be 30 minutes
-  There will be no time for questions
-  Practice your talk, hopefully in front of at least 1 other person

Presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This year, we will not be allowing time after the presentations for
questions, we feel posing questions for the speaker is best done on a
more limited basis. If any attendees have questions, they will be
instructed to come up to stage to present them to the speaker, rather
than take up the time of the rest of the audience.

Make sure when you practice your presentation, you are not counting on
extra time at the end for questions. You should plan on speaking for the
full 30 minutes of your speaking slot. Don't worry if you run a little
short on time however, we are happy to provide attendees with extra time
during talk breaks.

Make sure to practice your talk ahead of the conference. If you haven't
spoken before, your time will likely run a bit shorter on stage than
when you are practicing. Matt Haughey wrote a `guide on giving a
presentation <https://medium.com/@mathowie/an-introverts-guide-to-better-presentations-be7e772b2cb5>`__
that might be a tremendous help to you if you are new to presenting in
front of audiences.

Slides
~~~~~~

Slides should be in 16:9 resolution, though we can support 4:3 as well.
As a back up plan, have a PDF version of your slides. This will allow us
to have everyone's talks ready to display if there are any technical
issues the day of the conference.

You'll be responsible for making sure your laptop, or other display
device, is ready for your presentation. Be familiar with setting up an
external display on your machine, each presenter will have several
minutes for set up before the talk starts.

In case you missed it last year, Christina Elmore gave a great talk that
is relevent to many of us. Resist your urge to document with your
presentation, you are here for the room. We highly recommend watching
the full talk:
