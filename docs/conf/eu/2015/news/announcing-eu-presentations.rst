Announcing Presentations, Speakers, and Schedule
================================================

Our talk selection process has just wrapped up and we're eager to
announce the presentations for this year's conference. Each year we
select talks that emphasize intersections between tech writers,
developers, designers, and translators, because we all have so much to
learn from each other.
