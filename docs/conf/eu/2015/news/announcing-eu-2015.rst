Announcing Write the Docs Europe 2015
=====================================

We are excited to announce the 2015 European conference!

   will be in **Prague, Czech Republic on August 31 - September 1,
   2015.**
-  The conference will be held at **Klub Lavka** in the Praha 1
   historical city center.

Conference
~~~~~~~~~~

Join us for a two-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about documentation
systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and
`Wabi-sabi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi>`__.

The main event takes place on August 31 - September 1 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm. Our venue, `Klub
Lavka <http://www.lavka.cz/en/>`__, sits right `on the bank of the
Vltava river <https://goo.gl/maps/OHjne>`__, in the historical city
center of Prague, overlooking the Charles bridge.

Auxiliary Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize other
events so that people can get to know each other better. These events
are optional, but we strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or
early Sunday to participate.

This year, these events will include:

-  City Tour (Sunday morning) --- Join us for a walking tour of the old
   city center around the beautiful and historical sights that Prague
   has to offer.
-  Conference Reception (Sunday evening) --- Come early, get your badge,
   and get to know other attendees.
-  Official Party (Monday night) --- Wind down and talk about the day's
   talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.
