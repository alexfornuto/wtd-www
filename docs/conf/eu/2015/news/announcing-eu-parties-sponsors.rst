========================================================

We're nearly one month away from our Prague conference, and we're happy
to share some more news and updates with you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our main conference party is confirmed to be held at `The PUB Praha

conference venue. Join us from 7pm to relax and chat with fellow
attendees about the conference day. Free drinks of all variaties (soft,
still, alcoholic) as well as snacks and sweets will be provided.

Closing Meetup by Elastic - Tuesday Night (Sept 1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After two days of intensive talks, we'd like to invite those of you who
are still in town to join our friends at
`Elastic <http://elastic.co/>`__ who will host our closing meetup. The
evening will include a short introduction to Elastic by `Karel
Minarik <https://twitter.com/karmiq>`__, with plenty of time for
socializing and relaxing. Drinks and snacks will be provided by Elastic.

The exact time and location will be announced soon. Stay tuned!

Friends-and-Family Tickets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're traveling with friends or family to Prague, we're happy to
offer them the opportunity to join you for the city tour on Sunday
morning as well as the main conference party on Monday evening.

The **Friends-and-Family** tickets are `on sale
now <https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-eu-2015>`__ for â‚¬25. Due
to capacity restrictions at the party venue, we can offer only a limited
number of these tickets, so don't wait to purchase.

**A note for conference attendees:** The city tour and main conference
party are already included in the full conference ticket, but the
tickets are selling fast and we expect to sell out soon.
