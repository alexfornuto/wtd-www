Visiting Prague
===============

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Prague?
The conference will be held at the `Klub
Lavka <http://www.lavka.cz/en/>`__, in the old city center district of
Praha 1, and most conference events will be held within walking distance
of the venue.

Traveling to Prague
-------------------

Prague has many direct rail, bus, and flight connections to most major
European cities. In the summer, there are also direct transatlantic
flights to/from New York (JFK) and several other US airports.

Flights
~~~~~~~

Prague's `Vaclav Havel airport <http://www.prg.aero/en/>`__ provides
many direct and low-cost flights with airlines such as Czech Airlines,
Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air Berlin, Norwegian... You get the idea. To get
from the airport to the city center, you can either take a bus (average
joureny time 30 minutes, cost ~30czk) or a taxi (average journey time
15-20 minutes depending on traffic, cost ~500czk).

Trains
~~~~~~

Prague's main train station (Hlavni Nadrazi / hl.n) is a central railway
hub, with direct trains to Germany, Poland, Austria, and Hungary. We
recommend train lines by EuroCity (EC), InterCity (IC) or RailJet (RJ).
You can even take a train from Denmark `inside a
ferry! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie>`__

To look up train connections, head over to the `ÄŒD
Website <https://www.cd.cz/eshop/default.aspx>`__.

Buses
~~~~~

Prague is a popular destination among backpackers and shoestring
travelers, so there are many affordable bus options if you are traveling
within Europe. The biggest Czech bus company `Student
Agency <http://www.studentagency.eu/>`__ operates direct bus lines
between Prague and cities like Berlin, Vienna, Zagreb, Munich, etc.
Global companies like `Eurolines <http://www.eurolines.com/en/>`__
operate direct lines to many European cities.

Where to stay
-------------

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations,
but there are countless hotels and Airbnb apartments available within
walking distance of the venue. Just head over to your favorite booking
site or use one of these sites to research accommodation:

-  `AirBnB <https://www.airbnb.com/>`__
-  `Booking.com <http://www.booking.com/>`__
-  `Hotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>`__

If you need help or advice when considering a specific hotel or
apartment, send us an email at europe@writethedocs.org and we'll be
happy to help you out.

How to get around
-----------------

Prague is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

Navigating in Prague
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you navigate by smartphone, Google Maps is the most popular method to
calculate routes and travel times. Do exercise caution when calculating
walking routes, as the city center has many gated walkways that are
locked at night.

Trams, buses, and metro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Prague Public Transit Co. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/>`__ runs an
extensive network of trams, buses, and 3 metro lines. You can buy a
single ticket, day ticket, or 5-day pass at ticket machines, Trafika
stands (tobacconists) and at the train and bus stations.

If you're flying into Prague Airport (PRG), you can take bus number 100,
119, or the Airport Express (AE) bus. Depending on where you are
staying, these bus lines will connect you to several major metro
stations as well as the main train station. `More information on airport
transfers. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/public-transit-to-prague-airport/>`__

Taxi companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prague does have Uber but it's still pretty young and rides are not
easily located. However, there are several reliable local taxi
companies:

-  `AAA Taxi <http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/>`__
-  `Tick Tack <http://www.ticktack.cz/en>`__
-  `FIX Airport Taxi <http://www.airportcars.cz/?page=o-nas&lang=en>`__

IMPORTANT: Do not hail/flag taxis in the city center. As with most major
European cities, taxi scams do occur and can be easily avoided by
calling in advance or using an official taxi stand/rank (these are
marked with a *TAXI* sign and a posted fact sheet in Czech and English).
